Pending Update
* Will update with most recent employment (HCL America)
* Working on Certificates page.
* Updates to include projects worked on at HCL America
* I'm so bad at this.  If only there was 50 more hours in the day or didn't have to sleep.  Or maybe become half a robot.  That would be cool.
- LinkedIn is up-to-date (mostly)
