#### Questions
```sh
Why choose the domain .us instead of .com or .dev?
```
> First, it was available.  At the time, carloscastillo.com or any variation was already taken.  
> Second, it was the cheapest one.  I know, shocker.
> Third, hopefully, favored by search engines in the United States.

   
```sh
What languages do I mostly write in?
```
> C# has been my go-to.
> The standard Javascript, HTML/CSS.
> Some React, Java, and PHP.
> I hope to learn more about React and some Python in my free time.
```sh
Any cloud services?
```
> Azure.  I have a few years of professional  and personal experience in Azure.
> I also have 3 certifications related to Azure.  AZ-900, SC-900, DP-900. 
> Also about 3 months in WordPress.
